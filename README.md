# Snapcast Admin (snadmin)

## environment variables:
- `SNADMIN_FEED_ID` - ID of the podcast feed the script will operate on.
- `SNADMIN_TOKEN` - The authorization key for the podcast.
- `SNADMIN_B2_APP_KEY_ID` - Backblaze B2 Key ID
- `SNADMIN_B2_APP_KEY` - Backblaze B2 Key

The b2 stuff is pretty baked in unfortunately. Something to do for the future.
